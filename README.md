- 👋 Hi, I’m @woshiwpa
- 👀 I’m interested in designing and developing distributed programming languages for the future world.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning artifical intelligence but I think AI is still not comparable with human's brain. Human's brain has 86 billion neurons all of which can work in parallel. Nevertheless AI algorithm can take advantage of multi-core GPUs and I acknowledge that a GPU core is much more powerful than a neuron in brain. However, all the GPU cores are homogeneous and have to do similiar job in a parallel computing task. This introduces complexity in data sharing/alignment and task scheduling and, as a result, designing algorithms to tackle complicated problems is extremely difficult. Moreover, the number of cores is limited, thousands of powerful cores still cannot compete with 86 billion neurons. To cope with this bottleneck, a possible solution is to redesign programming language to take advantage computing powers of distributed and heterogenous devices.
- 💞️ To this end, I’m currently developing a new programming language called MFP, which means Mathematic language For Parallel computing. This is a cross platform scripting language for both JVM (repo name is MFPLang4JVM) and Android (repo name is MFPAndrioLib). Support and collaboration are very much welcomed. Feel free to send email to me if you have some great ideas about MFP.
